**Tip Jar** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Mahak Bansal**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added a launch screen to create a good first impression of the app.
- [x] Tested app using the dark mode feature of iOS to make sure no field is invisible due to the change in color scheme.
- [x] Introduced UI changes like a gradient background.
- [x] Added an App Icon.

## Notes

Getting used to the Swift syntax took fair amount of time. E.g. understanding the difference between an Int range and a String.Index range took fair amount of reading.
